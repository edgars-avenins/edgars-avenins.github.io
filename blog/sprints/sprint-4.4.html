                        <p><em><strong>How I got blocked on a simple problem.</strong></em> I had to write some code that would take a list of numbers and remove all odd numbers. I was using this code that was prewritten by people behind mozilla and it all seemed to be working until I noticed that 0 doesn't show up. As 0 is also even this was an issue. And although I suspected where the issue might be I was reluctant to test that path first as I would second guess some simpler code first. Ofcourse once I persuaded my initial doubts I quickly came to realise that this pre written code that I'm using doesn't consider 0 a worthy number of leaving it in my list. This was solved by changing 1 word...</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pseudocode, a lot of console, googling, trying a lot of things</li>
                            <li>Irritated, second guessing myself</li>
                            <li>Trust my gut a bit more, take a break and breathe</li>

                        <p><em><strong>How I solved a problem in an elegant way.</strong></em> This happened when I entered the final phase of this weeks javascript challenges. Suddenly in the code examples in front of me there is a new way of defining a function and man oh man how this confused me. First thing I had in my mind was to just rewrite it in the usual way I'm used to see them but I managed to stand firm against this temptation and started researching how this way of writing them works. Resources were a bit hard to understand at first but once I felt like I understand how to write them I actually succeeded with first attempt. Afterwards I even nested these functions which made me feel extra cool.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Googling, again lots of console entries, trying different ways to access/pass values</li>
                            <li>I was in the zone, although I didnt get to the result immediately I knew that I'm close and as this was a new concept it really tickled my brains</li>
                            <li>The power of console, I can't stress enough how much I use console when I'm writing JS</li>

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> I have been using Pseudocode in some form before but now I made aconscious attempt to be more specific with it and actually use it more often</li>
                            <li><strong>Trying something:</strong> I guess that is what most of us do whenever we encounter an issue and feel like we can guess it. I try random stuff quite often in conjunction with console.log</li>
                            <li><strong>Rubber Ducky method:</strong> Haven't tried this one yet. Can't say I will but it's there always on the back of my skull just in case.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> As so far most of the error messages have been understandable, no misterious words or paths that doesn't make sense. So for now I read them I understand them but I'm sure soon there will be more challenges here.</li>
                            <li><strong>Console.logging:</strong> Already mentioned it few times because it's the best thing. You can type your code in console and as it is so easy to see what it returns once it is working as intended you just copy/paste to editor. Or write in editor and paste in console and test it.</li>
                            <li><strong>Googling:</strong> The most important one. I would guess. I feel like I'm getting better at describing my problems with each day and pretty much that is what matters. How precise your description of problems is, is what matters.</li>
                            <li><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> Haven't done it yet as I see that as last resort. Might try it just so someone gets a chance to try and explain</li>
                            <li><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Would happen only if I would be superstuck</li>
                            <li><strong>Improving my process of reflection:</strong> Need to work on it a bit more as quite often I would quickly skim over my solutions and carry on</li>
                        </ul>
