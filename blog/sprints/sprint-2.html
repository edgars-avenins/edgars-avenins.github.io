                <strong>Honesty</strong>
                            <p>Some time ago I decided that it's time to stop lying to myself first of all and be truthfull with my loved ones aswell. 
                        Before changing the world make sure to change yourself.
                        </p>
                   <strong>Determination</strong>
                            <p>I always have been able to fixate myself if I really want to. It's always nice to be in this state as it feels superfocused
                        all the time. The only problem is that I may become obsessively determined
                        </p>
                    <strong>Bravery</strong>
                            <p>Just to stand up for yourself or to be willing to raise unwanted questions. Speak your mind and walk the talk.
                        I consider these traits very important as they show what you're made of. 
                        </p>
                        <strong>Freethinker</strong>
                            <p>Question everything. This might have gotten me into quite a lot of clashing situations just because if there is no good
                        explanation behind why this is done that way and not other way I would question that and oh my.. people hate when their methods
                        get questioned. I feel like this could be applied to any level of structure(your work environment, your company hierarchy, your government)
                        </p>
                        <strong>Kind</strong>
                            <p>This trait borders with selfless for me. Because I know that if help can be delivered I will make sure I do everything in my power.
                        There has been few situations where fast thinking and acting was necessary and looking back at these I feel like I got what it takes
                        to remain levelheaded. Also always ready to help with advice or hear you out and share my insights.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Ethical Decision</strong>
                        <p>While not everyone knows that admitting your mistakes is a big step in growing. From my personal experience often people will deny any mistakes unless caught red-handed.
                            And that is where my confrontation and whether it's worth it and is it going to achieve the intended goal situational calculations come in.
                            In different work environments I personally never had issues with saying: "Yeah, that was me and I'll learn from this mistake".
                            But more then often I would see the complete opposite behaviour from my colleagues. I had my pratice with heated arguments few times.
                            And now whenever there would be a potential for these situations I would stop and question myself. Is it worth it ?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Values and identity influenced by culture</strong>
                            <p>I think honesty as it is sitting on top of my list it's also very important for me. And culture has played a big role
                        in making sure it's my top trait. Where I'm from it was very common that people would trick you, lie to your face but 
                        I never witnessed that in my household and even when as a teenager I lied I felt like garbage afterwards because that was 
                        so moraly against everything that I am. And since then I have tried to be honest with myself and the people around me.
                        If you're lying, you're actually lying to yourself and then the question arises - do you even have an idea who you might me.
                        </p><p>
                            Determination and freethinker has clear roots aswell because I remember myself as being the kid who would question his teachers
                        just because I wanted to hear more indept explanation.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Strengths and limitations</strong><p>
                        I'm a firm believer that each of us build prisons around ourselves by saying and thinking things like: I can't do this, 
                        it's to hard for me, I'll never be able to do it etc...</p><p>
                        Ofcourse that doesn't mean that there aren't limitations or just things that one person is naturally better at than other one.
                        To some extent we are limitless as long as we realize that our biggest friend and enemy is the same person - ourselves.
                        But as I'm just a human then my biggest limitations would be lack of self confidence I wont dive into other possible limitations
                    </p><p>I feel like this is my main one from which we have other branching off. And I try to work on it when I remember but that's an 
                        ongoing everyday battle.</p><p>
                        As for strengths my freethinking spirit and critical mind will be my best tools while sucking up all the information then i'll 
                        combine it with some determination and vuala then throw in some kindness and share the knowledge.
                        As for learning obstacles what's important is to avoid getting overwhelmed by them. Take a step back indetify your obstacle. 
                        Treat them as problems that require solving and all the relative steps.
