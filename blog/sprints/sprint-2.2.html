                                            <li>Mindfulness about others. As sometimes my mouth might move a bit faster than my brain and super rarely I would managed to talk my way into uncomfortable situations by being too direct</li>
                                            <li>Comunication and how to do it as quite often I would find it hard to speak about things that fascinate me</li>

                                            <li>I'm not here to try something out and hopefully get a developers job afterwards. I'm here to finally put career on the right way and actually do something I enjoy</li>
                                            <li>In preparation to EDA I have made sure that there wouldn't be any financial problems, my partner is well aware of the upcoming workload and time has been prioritised accordingly.</li>
                                            <li>My productivity will be achieved by planning my time. As of now entering sprint-3 there is still plenty of time to pick up habits that will help me to give my best and share my knowledge while attending EDA</li>

Only once I have failed to resolve this multiple times I shall reach out to my cohort first of all(If someone knows the answer they make their neural pathways stronger and I get to move on - win win// think of cohort as a big family).</li>
                                            <li>Problems that cant be solved by my peers will be directed to programme coaches/tutors</li>
